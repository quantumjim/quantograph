# Quantograph
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/quantumjim/quantograph/master?filepath=quantograph.ipynb)

A toy for making pixel art animations with quantum computation using the [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org) framework.

It runs in a Jupyter notebook. You can either download and run it yourself, or use [this](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/quantumjim/quantograph/master?filepath=quantograph.ipynb) web-hosted version.

A tutorial on how it works can be found [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/quantumjim-patch-1/community/games/quantum_animations.ipynb).

Made as part of [Pyweek 27](https://pyweek.org/27/)

Also see the related [teleportation](teleport.ipynb) notebook, in which the same principles are used to create transitions between images using swap gates.
